Pros of blue-green:
High detention storage volume (their minimum for open storage is around 100mm, which is around our maximum for the honeycomb).
Very good at accepting water from contributing areas.
Cons of blue-green:
Usually heavier; usually done with semi-intensive or sometimes intensive,
Requires a 0% deck, which is uncommon,

Difficult to employ on small roofs, or roofs with a high ratio of drains, because much of the infrastructure and cost is at the drain itself.
Other blue-green factors to consider:
Blue-green relies on orifice restriction.  Orifices can become clogged, but I wouldn't play this up too much, because the better blue-green systems have this worked out pretty well.
Most blue-green systems use smart technology to open and close orifices.  These could be considered a pro or a con by different clients.  But smart technology does require internet service, maintenance, and monitoring.
Pros of Purple:
Flexible detention storage volume,
Works well on 2% slope (will work on slopes above that, but values not confirmed yet),
Easily deployed on large, rectangular roofs and small, chopped-up roofs.
Detention capabilities on small, irregular, chopped up roofs, and roofs with high ratio of drains is still very good,
Less expensive than blue-green,
Available in thin, lightweight profiles,
100% passive with built-in redundancy; friction layer is highly unlikely to clog, but even if portions did clog, since the layer covers 100% of the surface, there is tremendous redundancy in flow paths.
Cons of Purple:
Well suited to accepting water from contributing areas, but to a lesser extent than blue-green.  
Lower total storage volume than blue-green.
